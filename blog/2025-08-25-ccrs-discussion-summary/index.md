# WCIA CCRS Discussion Summary Report

---

## Background

Confidence Analytics, a testing laboratory in Washington State, submits monthly Public Records requests for the complete 
CCRS database. Since approximately April 20, 2025, we have observed a significant decline in system performance. This 
decline has affected integrators and licensees across their operations, particularly in terms of CSV upload and response 
times. The performance degradation is evident in the database, with over 75% of its data missing in the last 60 days, 
and the situation is worsening. Current response times have now reached an average of 26 days.

On August 25, 2025, Confidence Analytics hosted a meeting for WCIA participants. The objective of this meeting was to 
collaboratively assess the current state of the CCRS traceability system and explore potential strategies for enhancing 
system stability and interoperability.

## Discussion

### A Common Experience.

Laboratories in attendance confirmed shared experiences regarding educational visits from the Examiner’s office, as well 
as requests for various CCRS data, much of which had been previously submitted or involved samples that were manifested 
but never received. Integrators echoed these concerns, reporting similar instances of data degradation and increased 
response delays. Some participants highlighted new challenges with automated login systems, particularly regarding 
cookies with significantly shorter expiration periods.

### A Common Interest

There was a general consensus that a community-supported database and API, or similar technological solutions, could 
provide substantial value. Among the potential benefits discussed were the establishment of a more comprehensive and 
stable set of traceability data, improved integration between CCRS and interoperability data, and the possibility of 
enhancing exposure prevention measures.

### A Concern About State Participation

Participants expressed concerns regarding the likelihood of the LCB and/or State being receptive to participating in 
cooperative solutions or adopting a more effective community-supported alternative. It was recommended to engage the 
LCB or other policymakers to assess their interest before committing significant resources. Caitlein Ryan, Director of 
the Cannabis Alliance, indicated she may have insights on how to approach entities such as the LCB Board and other 
policymakers to gauge their interest.

## Next Steps

Following this summary, Confidence Analytics will collaborate with the Cannabis Alliance to provide a more comprehensive 
overview of the system issues and extend an offer of support in engaging State stakeholders to identify a suitable 
solution for the current traceability challenges. Additionally, Confidence Analytics will develop a proof of concept 
“mirror” database with an API, allowing interested WCIA participants to examine the current state of the CCRS dataset 
and evaluate the potential benefits of a more complete dataset.
