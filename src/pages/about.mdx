# About the WCIA

The Washington Cannabis Integrators Alliance, or WCIA, is a collaborative organization created and operated by industry
professionals and dedicated to advancing interoperability and efficiency within the cannabis industry of Washington State.
Created in 2021 in response to the challenges faced by cannabis businesses in coordinating product movement between their
operations, the WCIA provided a unified platform for data sharing and integration. Participation is voluntary, and open
to all cannabis businesses in Washington State, including professional integrators, cultivators, processors, retailers,
and other stakeholders.
