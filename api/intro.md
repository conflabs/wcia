## Welcome to the WCIA Exploratory API! 

We are currently working to quickly open an API layer to the CCRS "Mirror" database, so that WCIA participants may
explore its structure and contents. The data found within are acquired by public records requests to the State of 
Washington. It is a work currently in progress.

In the side navigation bar you'll find a documentation illustrating the database tables and JSON models. These will be
joined shortly by API endpoint documentation, but for now please explore via the schema.
